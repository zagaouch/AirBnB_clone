#AirBnB Clone Project
Background Context

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

This project will teach you how to build a full-stack web application using a variety of technologies, including:

#Command interpreters
HTML/CSS templating
Database storage
REST APIs
Front-end integration
First Step: Write a Command Interpreter

The first step in this project is to write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects. This command interpreter will be used in all subsequent steps of the project.

What's a Command Interpreter?

A command interpreter is a program that allows users to interact with a computer by typing commands. In the context of this project, the command interpreter will allow you to create, retrieve, update, and delete AirBnB objects.

#Tasks

The following tasks are included in this step:

Create a parent class called BaseModel to take care of the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of your future instances.
Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel.
Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
Create all unit tests to validate all your classes and storage engine.
Conclusion

This first step is very important because it will provide you with the foundation for building a full-stack web application. In the subsequent steps of this project, you will use the command interpreter to create and manage AirBnB objects, as well as to implement other features of the AirBnB clone.
